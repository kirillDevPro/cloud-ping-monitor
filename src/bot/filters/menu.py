"""Routing filter for translated main-menu reply buttons.

Reply-keyboard buttons are matched by their exact visible text, so once a button
label is translated the old ``F.text == "📊 Мониторинг"`` filter would only match
one language. :class:`MainMenuButton` matches a menu key against the label in
EVERY supported language, so a handler keeps firing regardless of the user's
current language.

The label set is resolved once at construction time (router import / startup);
the catalog is static, so there is nothing to recompute per update.
